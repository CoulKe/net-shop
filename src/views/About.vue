    <h1>Net shop</h1>
    <p>Net shop is just a made up name and it's not associated with any company/brand that may have the same name.</p>
    <p>I built this website just for practice purposes and it acts as an ecommerce demo.</p>
    <p>To check my official website, go to <a href="https://thatcoul.netlify.app">my portfolio</a> and there you can find my other contacts.</p>
